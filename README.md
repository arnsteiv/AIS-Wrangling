# AIS wrangling: Near Collision Situations
Function hierarchy for computing summary statistics on near-collision situations. Is implemented idiosyncratically, but can be adapted to fit different AIS data, and is somewhat flexible. 

- Workflow sets out usage with checkpoints, to be executed by sending line by line to python kernel
- Condensed workflow can be modified to be run as a single script
- NearCollisionStatistics is the module to be called upon

See also code for exploratory analysis in R in separate folder.

Part of project on computing summary statistics on near-collision situation. See [project paper](https://github.com/vestre/AIS-Wrangling/blob/master/Final_Report.pdf).

Status update August 2020: Project is written to a paper, and submitted. Will post updated code and paper upon acceptance.
