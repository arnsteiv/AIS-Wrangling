# NearCollisionSituations
Function hierarchy for computing summary statistics on near-collision situations. Is implemented idiosyncratically, but can be adapted to fit different AIS data, and is somewhat flexible. 

- Workflow sets out usage with checkpoints, to be executed by sending line by line to python kernel
- Condensed workflow can be modified to be run as a single script
- NearCollisionStatistics is the module to be called upon

See also code for exploratory analysis in R in separate folder.

Part of project on computing summary statistics on near-collision situation. See paper: Link.
